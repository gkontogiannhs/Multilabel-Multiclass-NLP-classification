## This repo hosts a project which tries to find and fine tune the most suitable neural network model for multi-label multi-class classification using NLP teqnuiches with the DeliciousMIL dataset.

### Builts:
Different dimensionalities for Multi layer Dense NN with:
- The naive bag of words teqnuiche as input
- Word embeddings (embedding layer)
- LSTM layer
- Embedding + LSTM layers
