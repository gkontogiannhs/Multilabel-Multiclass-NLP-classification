## This repo hosts a project which tries to find the best neural network model for multi-label multi-class classification using NLP teqnuiches using the DeliciousMIL dataset.

### Builts:
Different dimensionality for Dense NN with:
- The naive bag of words teqnuiche
- Word embeddings
- LSTM
- Word embeddings - LSTM
